# Herald Interface

This repository contains the data models and interfaces that define the contract between the Herald SDK and the Herald Server. It is designed to be used by developers who are integrating with the Herald system for optimization tasks.

## Overview

The Herald Interface project provides the necessary structs and validation methods that are shared across the SDK and server implementations. This ensures consistency and interoperability between different components of the Herald system.

## Authors

- **Sergio** - *Developer* 


## Usage

The structs and methods defined in this interface are used to construct requests and interpret responses between the client SDK and the Herald Server. They are also used to validate the data before it is sent or processed.
